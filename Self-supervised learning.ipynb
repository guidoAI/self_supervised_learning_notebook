    "### Why self-supervised learning in robotics\n",
    "Normally, when thinking of 'learning robots', one thinks of reinforcement learning or imitation learning - both learning settings in which robots attempt to directly learn better control policies. A more recent form of learning, which typically involves the learning of perceptual abilities, is _self-supervised learning_ (SSL). \n",
    "\n",
    "A self-supervised learning robot provides its own supervised learning targets. This seems strange at first: Why would a robot want to learn what it already knows?\n",
    "\n",
    "The best example to illustrate why SSL is useful, is perhaps also the most famous and one of the first robots to use SSL: The robot 'Stanley' used SSL to win the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2005 [1]. In that challenge, autonomously driving cars had to drive a 212 km long, off-road course, as fast as possible. Stanley's programs consisted of a lot of impressive elements, but one of the most important and interesting ones was the use of SSL for looking further ahead. The SSL scheme was set up as follows: Stanley could use its LiDAR measurements to reliably detect whether the ground ahead consisted of drivable terrain (road) or not. However, the range of the LiDAR measurements was limited. In contrast to the LiDAR, Stanley's cameras could see the ground and terrain also at very large ranges. This led to the following learning setup: at the close distances, LiDAR provided supervised training for a vision algorithm that learned a mapping from visual appearance (color, texture) to terrain labels (drivable / non-drivable). Then, the vision algorithm could be applied to areas higher up in the image, beyond the LiDAR range. \n",
    "\n",
    "This self-supervised learning setup allowed Stanley to detect the road further ahead, speed up, and win the race (by 11 minutes on the 212km track!).\n",

    "### Definition of self-supervised learning\n",
    "Supervised learning is one of the major problem settings within machine learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Definition:* _\"Supervised learning is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.\"_ (From <A HREF=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Wikipedia</A>)\n",
    "\n",
    "_Self-supervised learning_ (SSL) is a newer, less known form of machine learning and hence its definition is also less established. In fact, SSL is a subset of supervised learning, which sets a restriction on how the example input-output pairs are obtained. That is, these example pairs are not determined by a human, but are self-generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Definition:* _\"Self-supervised learning is a type of supervised learning where the training labels are determined by the input data.\"_ (From <A HREF=\"https://machinelearning.wtf/terms/self-supervised-learning/\" TARGET=\"_blank\">Machine Learning Glossary</A>)\n",
    "\n",
    "From a robotics stand point, the defition could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Definition:* _\"Self-supervised learning is a type of supervised learning where the training labels are generated by the robot itself.\"_ \n",
    "\n",
    "From a machine learning stand point, self-supervised learning is equal to supervised learning. This means that the methods and principles for supervised are also applicable to self-supervised learning. Hence, one can wonder whether it is useful to make a distinction between supervised learning and SSL. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main property of SSL is that the self-supervised setup allows for the generation of large numbers of training examples, without any human effort. This is a huge advantage for deep learning methods, which perform much better when ample training data is available. Of course, the automated generation of training examples has consequences on the problem setting. For example, in a robotic scenario, training examples will come continuously from the robot's sensors. This means that these examples are typically statistically dependent on each other. This goes in against the typical assumption of _independent, identically distributed_ (i.i.d.) samples. Moreover, training examples are not verified by a human, so the training set could contain more wrong examples or more noise than in a typical, human-made training set.\n"
